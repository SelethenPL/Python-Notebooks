# Python-Notebooks
A set of smaller python projects related more or less to AI or ANN.

* Decision_Tree.ipynb → implementation of decision tree algorithm for Titinic Surival dataset.

* Image_Colorization.ipynb → CNN testing for image colorization problem, checking few different models.

* K_NN_classifier.ipynb → KNN classifier operation test.

* Monte_Carlo_Frozen_Lake.ipynb → implementaton for Frozen Lake problem. Policy iteration, value iteration, on-policy Monte Carlo (for epsilon-greedy).

* Retina_Analyzer.ipynb → two approaches to retina analyze problem. Using only morphological transformations and using KNNClassifier.
